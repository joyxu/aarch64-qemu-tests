Create a Debian rootfs for DragonBoard 410C

This uses qemu to handle the second-stage of the debootstrap and uses
qemu-debootstrap called from grml-debootstrap. 

You will need to have these packages installed:

	sudo apt-get install wget grml-debootstrap android-tools android-tools-fsutils

1. Run make

2. Boot the Linaro Ubuntu release from the SD card installer. This will partition the eMMC appropriately.

3. Use the recovery disk image to boot the DB410C into fastboot. Make sure the dip switch for SD Boot is ON.

4. Login (root, root)

5. timedatectl set-ntp true
