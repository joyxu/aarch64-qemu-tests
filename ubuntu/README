Based on instructions at:

Run "make" to download the required files, configure the rootfs and boot
into Ubuntu. 

The script requires sudo so it can chroot into the rootfs and configure it.

You will be requested to set the timezone, add the user ubuntu and the password,
and set the root password.

You will then be presented with the login prompt for Ubuntu running under QEMU
the initial login seems to take about 30 seconds. Not sure why.
